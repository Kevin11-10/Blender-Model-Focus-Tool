# Blender-Model-Focus-Tool
A Blender add on to allow to focus on one particular model selected and restore back to the view you left

# Step 1: Install and Enable the Add-on
Download the Code: Download the isolate_focus_keymap.py file.

Install: In Blender (version 4.1 or newer), go to Edit → Preferences... → Add-ons.

Click Install... and select your saved Python file.

Enable: Search for "Isolate and Focus Tool" and check the box to enable it.

# Step 2: Use the Default Shortcut
Once enabled, the default shortcut Ctrl + Alt + F will be active in the 3D Viewport.

Select an object.

Press Ctrl + Alt + F to Isolate and Focus.

Press Ctrl + Alt + F again to Restore the full scene.

# Step 3: Customize the Shortcut (The Preferences Area)
To change the keyboard shortcut:

In the Blender Preferences (Edit → Preferences...), go to the Add-ons tab.

Find the "Isolate and Focus Tool" add-on.

Click the arrow on the left to expand its details.

A new section will appear titled "Customize Isolate and Focus Shortcut:".

Adjust the settings:

Change the "Main Key" (e.g., change 'F' to 'I').

Toggle the "Use Ctrl," "Use Alt," or "Use Shift" checkboxes.

Apply Changes: After making changes, you must disable the add-on (uncheck the box) and then re-enable it (check the box again) for the new keymap to take effect. This is a requirement when changing keymaps in Blender add-ons.
